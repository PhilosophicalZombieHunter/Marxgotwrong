# Marx’s Top Mistakes in his Economic Theories


1. **Ignores competition for quality labour** Marx’s theories ignore the specialisation of workers and the scarcity of those skilled or experienced labourers. There is the assumption that this is to do with his understanding of Smith's division of labour. While things like the Pareto Principle or Price’s Law came after Marx, he disregards the notion that some people can be more productive and contribute more than others at the same task. This attitude, steers Marx away from obvious concepts in an economy, such as Capitalists competing for scarce skilled workers or scarce highly experienced workers (the productivity theory of wages). Marxists today believe that the market is simply workers competing for the lowest wage (Marx’s version of the Iron Law of Wages). 
> A use-value, or useful article, therefore, has value only because human labour in the abstract has been embodied or materialized in it. How, then, is the magnitude of this value to be measured? Plainly, by the quantity of the value creating substance, the labour, contained in the article. The quantity of labour, however, is measured by its duration, and labour-time in its turn finds its standard in weeks, days and hours.
> 
> Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labour are embodied, or which can be produced in the same time, have the same value. The value of one commodity is to the value of any other, as the labour-time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other. “As values, all commodities are only definite masses of congealed labour-time".
>
> The equation, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth one coat, implies that the same quantity of value-substance (congealed labour) is embodied in both; that the two commodities have each cost the same amount of labour or the same quantity of labour-time.
2. **Ignores the origins of innovations.** Division of labour focuses on breaking up parts of a complicated process into simple parts. Smith gave a hint on how innovation works when people “focused their whole minds” on these simple processes and improved or automated them. Ideas are not necessarily labour and the concept of innovation is very much absent from Marx’s work and he does not identify people’s reason as the force behind innovation. Instead of the ability to reason, Marx identifies the opposable thumb as the thing that would lift mankind above the rest of the animal world. Marxists today see all highly intellectual work and manual work as just labour. Marxists today have no ability to conceive the value innovators bring and what the prime movers in markets are.
3. **Companies Compete on Innovation.** Schumpeter noted that Marx ignores how companies do not necessarily compete on prices, but on innovation. Companies try to make better products that would persuade customers to by their products instead of the competition. Companies or entrepreneurs that innovate an entirely new market can make the highest profit possible for a period of time. Marx would rather believe that capitalism tends to consolidate companies over time into monopolies, because they are essentially offering the same thing without the ability to create something new. 
4. **Exchange is not a Zero-Sum Game.** While Marx believed that individual people can gain increased value of use by exchanging goods, he does not believe (nor did Ricardo) that there is an increase in the exchange value from the trade. In other words, you cannot profit from an exchange, unless you are cheating someone. If the value of a commodity was in fact, tied to its use or utility, then the exchange itself would create more economic value and therefore lead to economic growth. Marxists today (and a lot of other people) do not understand any activity that results in a trade, leads to economic growth - and instead believe that economies constantly need finite resources in order to grow. However, human innovation is infinite and new activities from it can lead to infinite growth.  
5. **Doesn't apply to service sector.** Marx didn’t see services as productive labour as they did not produce commodity goods.  All 1st world economies have over 80% of their workforce employed in the service sector. Marxists today are divided on this with some Marxists preferring to use newer thinker for this area. 
6. **Ignores Risk in Markets.** Marx did not consider possibilities of commodity products not being sold, delayed in payments, capital investments being written off, businesses not working out and in general, the concept of risk being taken on by business owners. Taking on risk by the business owner and away from the workers, reduces the claim of exploitation. For example, if a company manufactures a product which is then sold on to a wholesaler who will only pays for those products 90 days later, the Capitalist takes on risk in their commitment to pay the workers a wage at the end of each month and as a result, can take a percentage of the profits without exploiting the workers (Time preference). Another point of risk that is being ignored is capital invested in innovations and new ventures. 9 out of 10 companies do not produce a return on investment and businesses on average die out after 10 years. 
7. **C / V** - The ratio of constant capital to variable capital does not tend to tilt to the constant capital side. There have been studies that prove that across industries and economies, companies biggest expense is wages and not machines. An example of this would be sewing machines and the Luddites. The Luddites were afraid that sewing machines would replace the jobs of seamstresses. However, 26 years after the rebellion ended, the garment industry had hired 4400% more people than it did before. 
8. **Scarcity comes from Nature and not Class Conflict.** Marx’s primitive communism and ideas he got from Rousseau puts across the idea that nature is abundant, peaceful and protective. If there is scarcity in a society, it must be because certain classes and the institutions behind them, make it that way. This seems to be a key concept in his conflict theory and even Marxists today believe that scarcity has been solved and any scarcity is an injustice.
9. **The Jews.** Marx lived during the time when Jews were just starting to get emancipated across Europe. However, [since the Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_antisemitism#Disabilities_and_restrictions), Jews were not allowed to own land in Europe and Russia - and occasionally, were kicked out of countries entirely with whatever they can carry. By not being allowed to own land, they would not have been able to rent seek as landlords or acquire properties to be used as 'means of production'. Nor could they pass that wealth on to their children for them to inherit it. Despite this, Jews were able to accumulate wealth through trading, banking and saving - concepts that were not really discussed in Marx's works or considered to 'produce value'. Marx should have known this as his family came from that ethnicity: his grandfather was a rabbi and Marx was aware of Jewish history in what he wrote in "on the Jewish question". 
10. **Contradictions as a Philosophy.** Marx’s theories are at their core, based on ‘contradictions’ found in the dialectical process - which violates Aristotle's law of non-contradition. Here are some of the top contradictions in his theories: 
* Workers are both the most profitable component for a company and at the same time, the most costly.
* Surplus value somehow goes up while prices go down due to competition
* When the business is doing well, it's because of the workers and the value they contribute to the company. When the business in failing, it's because of bad decisions taken by the business owner.
* Everything is labour even if its highly intellectual work or unskilled manual labour. 
* Work is the essence of man, but the Capitalists don't work. 
* We've had over 20,000 years of labour with no real wealth, but labour is the only reason we have so much wealth now.
* Multiplying by 'infinity' to the C part of LTV in order to achieve the communism stage of society.
* Capitalists need to spend all their money on capital investments to be able to concentrate all money in society.
* Capitalists are after more surplus value and at the same time, displace and ultimately destroy the source of surplus value.
* A labourer's wages is just a previous labourer's labour time
* Marxists: "Marx is very complicated, nuanced and most people get him wrong".  
   Also Marxists: "With only a single forumla with 3 variables, you can understand the infinite complexity of an infinite number of economies"
* If Marxists critique a critique of Marx, no critique will be the same.
